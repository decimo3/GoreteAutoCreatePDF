# PDF_BOT

Program developed to create PDFs from folders containing images (images only).

The program opens a dialog box requesting a folder. The selected path will be used as a basis for searching for folders with images to generate the PDFs.

The PDFs will be generated with the name of the folder in which the images are contained. The image quality will be reduced to fit within an email.
